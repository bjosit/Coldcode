# Our Idea
There are lots of punishment and censorship systems in place already. You say a specific bad word online and it will most likely get you censored and/or muted or even banned. It's clear to the average player that punishment for rude behaviour doesn't work. Once you're muted or banned you just get even angrier than before and want to insult the other players in the game even more. Once you're un-muted/banned the average toxic player goes right back to insulting their fellow players.

What we really need isn't harsher punishment, that's just putting oil on the fire, because what is most often enough already, is making the player have some kind of incentive not to be rude online. A positive reinforcement to be a genuinely good contribution to the community.

# Snowflakes
Cold Code would like to present "Snowflakes". A multiplayer sanction currency system for toxic in-game behaviour. 
Imagine you join a round of Rocket League or any other round based game. At the beginning of the match there would be a pool of 100 Snowflakes. These Snowflakes are to be distributed fairly between all players currently playing in the match. 
However, if one player is being rude, racist or is showing any other kind of disruptive behaviour, he is forfeiting his fair share of the Snowflakes automatically. If it's a light offense he might lose up to five snowflakes, if he's being particularly toxic he could lose his privilege to all Snowflakes in that round. 
These Snowflakes are not lost, instead they are being redistributed between the other players in the match. This way there's no one being punished, it is clear from the beginning, that one would surrender their right to Snowflakes if you were to be disruptive. Instead of being punished, they are simply not rewarded, all the while adding to the Snowflake pouch of the person they're being disruptive to. 
It might seem that the best thing to do as a player in this environment is to just keep quiet so that you don't risk being offensive. That is of course not the goal at hand. We want to foster a positive community, motivating them to share their positive mindset. This is why people begin with a certain "rudeness"

# Rewards
Well of course, Snowflakes, or any currency for that matter, don't mean anything without some kind of value behind them. This is why Game Companies can exchange exclusive content like Weapon, Car or Hero Skins, Emotes or anything of the sort for Snowflakes from the players. Wouldn't this just be a lot more work with little return for the Companies, you might ask. 
Well this is actually a win-win-win-win system. 
- The players experience a nicer atmosphere in game, because if toxic people hate anything more than not being able to be angry and mad, it would be to give money to the people they're trying to be angry at. 
- Artists will be employed to create content for Game Studios. 
- Game Studios will be able to pay Cold Code Snowflakes to receive part of their subscription fee back, this incentivises them to create great content in their game, which in turn motivates players to be less toxic. 
- And last but not least Cold Code wins because they're vision is becoming reality. (And we receive an annual subscription fee, which is a great plus.)

The Twist? Snowflakes are not part of any game itself. They are part of Cold Codes Currency System, which is accessible from each game of our partners. This way the Game Developers are even more incentivised to create great content, since it's a competition between all of our partners to have Snowflakes spent in their games.
